"""Python library for driving a UFACTORY xArm7, in simulation or for real.

`Robot` is the usual entry point: it picks the real arm when the `ROBOT_IP`
environment variable is set and the MuJoCo simulation otherwise, so the same
script runs against either. The backends are also importable directly as
`RealXArm7` and `SimulatedXArm7`.
